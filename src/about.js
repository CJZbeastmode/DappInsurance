"DappInsurance is a service that provides insurance for Ethereum wallets. \
This app is built based on react (https://reactjs.org/) and uses gun database (https://gun.eco/) to store data. \
The entire insurance system, including transaction ledgers and database is completely decentralized, meaning that \
every single transaction and every single piece of data stored is transparent to all the users and public. In order \
to purchase insurance, install metamask on your browser (available on Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Microsoft Edge) and \
log into your Ethereum wallet first. Connect your wallet to DappInsurance by clicking the connect button in the top right \
corner and proceed. Use the insure button to fill out the form and then the system will provide you with a quote based on \
the usage of your wallet. If you decide to pay the fee and purchase the insurance, the fee will be transferred to the \
decentralized smart contract on the ethereum blockchain, which acts like a funding pool for all users. In order to file \
a claim, click the claim button and fill out the form. Enter the secret phrase that corresponds to your account and proceed. \
The admin users will respond to your claim as soon as possible. If your claim is accepted, compensation will be transfered from \
the smart contract to your insured wallet. \
